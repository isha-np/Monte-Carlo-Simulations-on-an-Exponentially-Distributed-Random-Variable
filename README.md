# Monte-Carlo-Simulations-on-an-Exponentially-Distributed-Random-Variable
To use MATLAB and Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the exponentially distributed random variable X with parameter lambda = 0.2 has a valid probability density function, and to find its mean.

For X to be a valid probability density function, the following property must be satisfied. The integration over all values in the sample space should be equal to one.

After running the MATLAB code, the waveform attained is as follows. Being an exponential function, the value of area under the PDF plot should be equal to one, as shown.

To find the mean of the random variable X, the MATLAB code is executed and the waveform attained is given below. It increases to a stable value of y=5 which is approximately equal to 1/ùúÜ. Thus, the given integral can be used to find the mean.
